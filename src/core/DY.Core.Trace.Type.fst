open DY.Core.Bytes.Type

/// This module defines the trace type.
/// It is separated from functions and predicates on trace (manipulation, invariants)
/// in order to avoid dependency cycles.
///
/// The trace is a log of every action that has happened during a protocol execution,
/// such as messages sent on the network, state storage or corruption by the attacker,
/// as is standard is symbolic analysis tools to express security properties.
///
/// Given a trace, we can for example deduce:
/// - what bytestrings are known by the attacker (see DY.Core.Attacker.Knowledge.attacker_knows),
/// - what principals are corrupt (see DY.Core.Label.is_corrupt),
/// - what protocol steps have been reached by some principals,
/// - and more!
///
/// In turn, the set of traces that are reachable by executions of the protocol
/// can be used to express security properties.
/// For example, confidentiality can often be expressed as:
///   in every trace resulting from an execution of the protocol,
///   if the attacker knows some secret key,
///   then it must have corrupt some principal.
/// As another example, authentication can often be expressed as:
///   in every trace resulting from an execution of the protocol,
///   if Alice has finished a handshake with Bob,
///   then Bob must have initiated a handshake with Alice.
///
/// The trace type is parametrized by the label type
/// as a trick to avoid problems with the positivity checker.
/// See `DY.Core.Label.Type` for more information.

/// Principals are described using strings (such as "Alice").

/// The trace is a list of trace entries.
/// Because the trace grows with time and the time is often represented going from left to right,
